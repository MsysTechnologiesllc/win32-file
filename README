== Description
  Additional methods for the File class on MS Windows. Plus, several existing
  methods have been redefined to make them work properly on MS Windows.

== Prerequisites
  * windows-pr
  * win32-file-stat

== Installation
  gem install win32-file

== Synopsis
  require 'win32/file'

  p File.long_path("C:/Progra~1")       # => C:\Program Files
  p File.short_path("C:/Program Files") # => C:\Progra~1

  # See redefined methods below

== Singleton Methods Added
  * File.long_path
  * File.short_path
