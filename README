  Please report any issues you find on the github page at:

  Or the Win32Utils project page at:

  http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.

== Version Issues
  As of 0.7.0, this gem has been significantly altered. Many of the
  methods included here have been split out into separate gems, and
  other methods have been overridden. In addition, as of 0.7.0, this
  gem uses FFI instead of win32-api. The 0.6.x series is to be
  considered deprecated.

  If you ware using win32-file 0.7.0 or later, you will be using
  a different version of win32-file-stat as well. Don't worry, the
  gemspec has been updated to use the correct gems.
